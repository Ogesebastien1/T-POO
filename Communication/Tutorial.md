## $${\color{blue}Dashboard}$$
This dashboard offers you a complete set of functions to help you manage your working hours. As soon as you arrive, you're greeted by a personalized message, and you can clock in and out directly via the “Clock in” button. This feature allows you to precisely record your entry and exit times, helping you to keep accurate track of your work periods. Whether you work a fixed or flexible schedule, this tool helps you stay organized.

You can also check your total hours worked for the week. For example, this week you've already accumulated 35 hours, an increase of 26% on the previous week. Thanks to this weekly tracking, you can easily assess your productivity and adapt to your goals. What's more, the points system allows you to see your monthly progress. This month, you have 235 points, even though there's a 30% drop compared to last month. This can encourage you to maintain a steady pace and improve your performance.

The recent activities section gives you a detailed history of your scores. You'll find the exact times at which you started and finished your work sessions. This gives you total control over your time, so you can check whether you're on schedule at all times.

Finally, your schedule for the coming days is also displayed, with the exact times planned for each day. This allows you to plan ahead and anticipate your next work slots, whether to adjust your schedule or better manage your free time.

In short, this dashboard gives you everything you need to keep track of your time, assess your performance, and optimally organize your days ahead. It's designed to help you stay productive while balancing work and rest.
